LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

For these applications, LangChain simplifies the entire application lifecycle:

Open-source libraries: Build your applications using LangChain's modular building blocks and components. Integrate with hundreds of third-party providers.
Productionization: Inspect, monitor, and evaluate your apps with LangSmith so that you can constantly optimize and deploy with confidence.
Deployment: Turn any chain into a REST API with LangServe.
Open-source libraries
langchain-core: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.
langchain-community: Third party integrations.
Some integrations have been further split into partner packages that only rely on langchain-core. Examples include langchain_openai and langchain_anthropic.
langchain: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.
LangGraph: A library for building robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph.
